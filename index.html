Three-dimensional mesostructures enrich coarse macrosurfaces
with complex features, which are 3D geometry with arbitrary topology
in essence, but are expected to be self-similar with no tiling
artifacts, just like texture-based material models. This is a challenging
task, as no existing modeling tool provides the right constraints
in the design phase to ensure such properties while maintaining
real-time editing capabilities. In this paper, we propose MesoGen,
a novel tile-centric authoring approach for the design of procedural
mesostructures featuring non-periodic self-similarity while
being represented as a compact and GPU-friendly model. We ensure
by construction the continuity of the mesostructure: the user
designs a set of atomic tiles by drawing 2D cross-sections on the
interfaces between tiles, and selecting pairs of cross-sections to be
connected as strands, i.e., 3D sweep surfaces. In parallel, a tiling engine
continuously fills the shell space of the macrosurface with the
so-defined tile set while ensuring that only matching interfaces are
in contact. Moreover, the engine suggests to the user the addition
of new tiles whenever the problem happens to be over-constrained.
As a result, our method allows for the rapid creation of complex,
seamless procedural mesostructure and is particularly adapted for
wicker-like ones, often impossible to achieve with scattering-based
mesostructure synthesis methods.
