### Downloading

This repository contains *submodules*, so **do not use** the *download zip* button provided by GitHub. To clone the repository using git, run:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/eliemichel/MesoGen.git
cd MesoGen
```

If you forgot to use the `--recurse-submodules`, you can get submodules with:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Dependencies

Before building, you may need some additional piece of software depending on your platform.

#### Windows

On Windows, you need [cmake](https://cmake.org/) and Python.

#### Linux

You can install the required dependencies with the following `apt` command line, or something similar on other packet managers:

```
sudo apt-get install python git cmake xorg-dev
```

#### OSX

You should only need [cmake](https://cmake.org/) and Python, but this has not been tested. Feel free to let me know if anything is missing.

### Building

This is a standard CMake project. Building it consits in running:

```bash
# Configure (create a 'build/' directory)
cmake -B build

# Build (create the executables)
cmake --build build --config Release
```

You can chose which compiler to use in the first call to `cmake`, using the `-G` option. See for instance [`build-msvc16.bat`](build-msvc16.bat) to build for Visual Studio 15 (2017), or the other build files for `mingw` or `gcc`. More easily, you can also just run one of those scripts, it will even get git submodules.

It is recommended to build in **Release mode** because the tiling library is slow in debug mode.

### Running

The executable file is created within the `build` directory, in `src/MesostructureGenerator` or `src/MesostructureGenerator/Debug` or `src/MesostructureGenerator/Release` or something similar depending on your compiler.

Run from the `share/samples` directory in order to easily load example scenes (using default values in the UI).

### Usage

TODO

### Troubleshooting

When using Visual Studio, if you encounter this error dialog when trying to run the solution generated by CMake:

![Start up issue](doc/images/startup-issue.png)

Right click on *MesostructureGenerator* in the solution explorer (right panel, in default Visual Studio window layout) and chose "Set as StartUp Project".
